performance_analysis_task:
  description: |
    Analyze performance based on:
      - {type}: one of overall, subject, chapter, topic  
      - {data}: the JSON object or array of performance stats for that level  

    Branch on {type}:
      • overall → summarize total_tests_taken, total_questions_attempted,
        overall_accuracy_percentage, overall_score_percentage + high-level feedback  
      • subject → for each subject object, call out strengths (accuracy ≥ 80%) and
        weaknesses (< 50%), then bullet insights  
      • chapter → same as subject but at chapter level  
      • topic   → same as subject but at topic level  

    Return a JSON with keys: level, summary, insights, recommendations.
